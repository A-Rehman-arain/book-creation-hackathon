# AI/Spec-Driven Technical Book

Welcome to the AI/Spec-Driven Technical Book, a comprehensive resource for AI developers and software engineers entering Physical AI and humanoid robotics.

## About This Book

This book focuses on connecting AI agents to humanoid robot bodies using modern robotics frameworks. Each module is designed to provide both theoretical understanding and practical examples to help you build intelligent robotic systems.

## Modules

This book is organized into several modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of AI-robot integration:

- **[ROS 2 as Robotic Nervous System](./modules/ros2-nervous-system/index.md)**: Learn how ROS 2 serves as the middleware connecting AI agents to robot hardware
- More modules coming soon...

## Getting Started

Each module includes:
- Clear learning objectives
- Detailed explanations with examples
- Practical code samples
- Exercises to reinforce learning

Navigate to the module you're interested in using the sidebar, or start with the [ROS 2 fundamentals](./modules/ros2-nervous-system/ros2-fundamentals.md) to build a strong foundation.
