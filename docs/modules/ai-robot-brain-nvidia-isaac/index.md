# AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to the AI-Robot Brain module! This module covers using NVIDIA Isaac tools to train, simulate, and deploy intelligent robot behavior with hardware-accelerated perception and navigation for humanoid robots.

## Overview

The NVIDIA Isaac platform provides a comprehensive set of tools for developing AI-powered robotic systems. This module explores:

- NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Isaac ROS for accelerated perception and VSLAM
- Nav2 for humanoid navigation and path planning

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will understand:
- How to leverage Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- How to implement accelerated perception pipelines with Isaac ROS
- How to configure Nav2 for humanoid robot navigation and path planning
- How these components work together in the humanoid AI stack

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts
- Familiarity with robotics perception and navigation
- Knowledge of NVIDIA GPU hardware concepts (for acceleration understanding)
