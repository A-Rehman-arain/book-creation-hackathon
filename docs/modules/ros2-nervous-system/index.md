This module covers ROS 2 as the middleware nervous system that connects AI agents to humanoid robot bodies. It's designed for AI developers and software engineers entering Physical AI and humanoid robotics.

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) serves as the middleware that enables communication between AI agents and physical robot hardware. This module will cover the fundamental concepts you need to understand to effectively connect AI systems to humanoid robots.

## What You'll Learn

- ROS 2 fundamentals: nodes, topics, services, and actions
- How to bridge Python AI agents to robot controllers using rclpy
- Understanding humanoid robot structure using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with robotics concepts (helpful but not required)
