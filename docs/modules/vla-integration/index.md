# Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module! This module covers connecting language, vision, and action by translating human intent into executable robot behaviors. This module targets AI and robotics engineers integrating LLMs, speech, and perception into robotic control systems.

## Overview

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems represent the integration of multiple AI modalities to create sophisticated robotic control systems. This module explores:

- Voice-to-Action conversion using speech recognition (OpenAI Whisper)
- Cognitive planning with LLMs to convert language into ROS 2 action sequences
- Vision-guided action execution and feedback loops

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will understand:
- How to implement voice-to-action conversion with OpenAI Whisper
- How to use LLMs for cognitive planning and action sequence generation
- How to implement vision-guided action execution with feedback loops
- How these components work together in the complete VLA pipeline

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts
- Familiarity with LLMs and natural language processing
- Knowledge of computer vision and robotics concepts
